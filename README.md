# Challenge

A real-time service that allows for vendors, such as flower shops or restaurants, to alert a system of a package needing to be delivered, for drivers to instantly see whatâ€™s in their pickup queue, and then to alert the vendors as to the state of the deliveries (in transit, and then delivered).

# approach

created a TCP server with Socket.io to allow different clients to speak to eachother to inform drivers when items are ready for pickup and notify vendors when their items are in transit and have been delivered

# install

run npm i to install all needed packages then nodemon
